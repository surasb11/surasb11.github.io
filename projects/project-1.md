Global warming is the long-term rise of average temperatures on earth's surface. The goal of this project is to analyze if change in temperature over time correlates to an increase in the size and frequency of natural disasters. Our research focused on the amount of Natural Disasters data for Earthquakes, Tsunamis and Volcanos over the years, which is compared to the data of Global Land Temperature.

We gathered data and standardized it across our metrics to ensure consistency. We used the Python Data Analysis Library to execute our formulas with Pandas, and Matplotlib to represent the data as graphs. We coded our website in HTML/CSS & JS to ensure users could access the graphs and analyze the findings.
