Global warming is the long-term rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system. The aim of this project is to analyze if change in land temperature over years has an effect on natural disasters, the amount of events and the magnitude of their effect.
On each page, you will find graphs represent the relationship between the amount of natural disasters and climate changes. For this project we had to research datasets of Tsunamis, Earthquicks, Volcanos and Global Land Temperature. 

First we needed to clean up our data and then calculate and create comparison graphs. Using Python Data Analysis Library,   with Pandas with cleaned up each data and calculated avarage temperature change for serten amount of years. Not all datasets had the same number of years and same amount of countries to compare them so in the process we had to cut some data and leave just that one which was matching. Then working with Matplotlib, we was able to visualizate our data in graphs and at the end create comparison graphs which will show us final results. 

To visualize our data on the web page we used HTML/CSS/JS. This langueges allows users to acsses to the data of global warming, and with vizualization of data on the graths, understan better if Global Land Temperature reacts to National Disasters.
