woonder.ai is a Python based project created as a team effort for Data Analytics Class at University of Miami. The project objective was to allow users to search for the least expensive option when traveling to more than 2 cities on a single trip.

woonder.ai was developed using python and Hipmunk.com API as a data source. Within two weeks, we created a beta model, that would generate all the possible permutations for a three-destinations flight search and sort the result by price.
